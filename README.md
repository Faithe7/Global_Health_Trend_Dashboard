# Analysis and Visualization of Global Health Trends from 2000 - 2021

## Introduction
This repository provides a comprehensive overview of global health trends from 2000 to 2021, focusing on key indicators such as Life Expectancy (LE), Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE), Fertility Rate, Adult Mortality Rate, and Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index. These indicators are analyzed in relation to GDP across countries, continents, and regions to understand health disparities and economic influences on public health.

## Key Indicators
- **Life Expectancy (LE):** average number of years a newborn is expected to live under current mortality conditions. It is a crucial indicator of a country’s overall health and socioeconomic development.
- **Healthy Life Expectancy (HALE):** average number of years a person is expected to live in good health, free from severe illness or disability. It provides a better measure of quality of life compared to total life expectancy.
- **Fertility Rate:** average number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime. It reflects reproductive health, access to family planning, and social-economic conditions.
- **Adult Mortality Rate:** measures the probability of dying between ages 15 and 60 per 1,000 population. It assesses the impact of diseases, healthcare access, and lifestyle factors on adult survival.
- **Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index:** measures access to essential healthcare services, including maternal care, vaccinations, and disease treatment. A higher UHC index indicates better healthcare accessibility and quality.
- **Gross Domestic Product (GDP):** total value of goods and services produced within a country. It serves as a key economic indicator influencing healthcare, infrastructure, and overall well-being.
- **Country Classification:** categorized based on UN regions (Continents), Sub-regions, SDG Regions and income level (as defined by the World Bank).

## Dashboard Insights
### Global Health Trend Overview
Global health has significantly evolved from 2000 to 2021, driven by advancements in healthcare access, economic growth, and policy interventions.

### Life Expectancy
Life Expectancy (LE) measures the average number of years a person is expected to live, reflecting healthcare quality, socioeconomic conditions, and disease burden. Over the past two decades, global LE increased from ~68 years (2000) to ~72 years (2021), driven by improvements in healthcare systems, disease control, and living standards. However, disparities persist across countries, income levels, and development status.

#### Map Insight
The shape map dynamically visualizes LE trends by year and country, showcasing progress in developed nations and gaps in low-income regions.
- 2000: Lowest LE in Sub-Saharan Africa & South Asia, largely due to infectious diseases and poor healthcare access.
- 2021: Significant LE improvements, especially in East Asia, Latin America, and parts of Africa, attributed to expanded healthcare programs and reduced mortality rates.

#### Drop in World Life Expectancy in 2020
In 2020, global life expectancy (LE) declined for the first time in decades, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Key factors contributing to this decline include:
- High COVID-19 Mortality: Millions of deaths, especially among the elderly and vulnerable.
- Healthcare Disruptions: Overburdened hospitals, delayed treatments, and reduced routine care.
- Public Health Setbacks: Interrupted vaccinations, maternal health services, and disease control programs.
- Economic & Social Impact: Increased poverty, mental health crises, and substance abuse.

#### LE vs. HALE (Healthy Life Expectancy)
Both LE and HALE have increased over time across most countries. HALE consistently makes up about 85–90% of total LE, meaning that while people are living longer, some years are lived with illness or disability.
- HALE measures years lived in good health, accounting for disabilities and disease burdens.
- HALE is consistently ~8-10 years lower than LE, highlighting the impact of chronic diseases, aging populations, and healthcare disparities.
- HALE growth is slower than LE, emphasizing the need for improved disease prevention and long-term healthcare strategies.

#### LE by Development Status (Developed vs. Developing Nations)
- **Developed Countries:** LE ranges from 70 to 80 years due to universal healthcare, medical advancements, and high living standards.
- **Developing Countries:** LE varies from 40 to 75 years, with growth depending on healthcare access, economic development, and public health initiatives. Many low-income nations still struggle with infectious diseases, maternal health, and healthcare accessibility.

#### LE and GDP Correlation
Higher GDP strongly correlates with higher LE (e.g., Europe, North America, Australia & New Zealand).
  
### Fertility Rate
The World Fertility Rate has experienced a significant decline over the past two decades, decreasing from 2.8 births per woman in 2000 to 2.3 births per woman in 2021. This global trend reflects a shift toward smaller family sizes, driven by economic development, improved healthcare, increased education levels, and greater access to contraception. However, the rate of decline varies considerably across continents, regions, and individual countries, influenced by socioeconomic factors, cultural norms, and government policies.
